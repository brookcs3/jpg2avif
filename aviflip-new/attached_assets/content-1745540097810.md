Advertising and Marketing Cookies

Like many companies, Cloudflare uses services that help deliver interest-based ads to you and may transfer Personal Information to business partners for their use, including via advertising and marketing cookies.

Cloudflare does not sell your Personal Information in the conventional sense (i.e., for money).
